# haxe-fen (fen)
A library to work with the Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN) for chess position records in Haxe.

It grants easy access to the six fields of a FEN record without the need to write a parser.

Also supplies a lot of other functions.

Currently only standard FEN is implemented. Shredder-FEN and X-FEN may be added in future versions.

## Installation
Install this library via haxelib by executing ```haxelib install fen```.

## Usage
Add ```--library fen``` or ```--L fen``` as compiler arguments or add the line to a ```.hxml``` file that is used for building.

Import classes and functions with ```import fen.*;```

## Documentation
Currently, the documentation is only found in the classes themselves. An online documentation will follow.

## About forks
It is highly endorsed to merge additions made in forks back into this repository via a pull requests and remove the fork once the pull request is approved. This way people don't stumble upon outdated forks and find all functionality in one place.
